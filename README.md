# nutriscore

Part 5

This part corresponds to the creation of ELECTRE-Tri models. 

The main file is Main.py. It defines the parameters and can call the following functions:
- save_total_sorts from Storage.py. This function aims to generate the ELECTRE-Tri models and store them in the Sorts folder.
- final_compare and stats_total_sorts from Model_comparison.py
- total_categories_comparison from Category_study.py

The ELECTRE-Tri models are stored in .csv files containing the original dataset and an additional column with the products’ categories generated by the model.

The models are then compared regarding 3 main axis:

- their distribution (in Model_comparison.py): stats_total_sorts function
- their order using pairwise comparison (in Model_comparison.py): final_compare function
- their categories, especially the average amount of each nutritional feature in each category (in Category_study.py): total_category_comparison function

The other files:
- parameter_creation.py generates the models’ limiting profiles
- MajoritySorting.py contains the generation of Majority Sorting models (not used)
- ELECTRE_Tri.py contains the functions PessimisticElectreSorting and OptimisticElectreSorting used to compute the ELECTRE-Tri models.
